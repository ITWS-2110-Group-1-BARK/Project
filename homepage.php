		<h1>About Us</h1> 
	    <p> Destined Duo is a web application where anyone can find someone in their area like 
            themselves looking to try the same new activity. New users can create a new account 
            and create a profile for themselves as well as creating specifications of what they are looking for 
            in an activity buddy. They can create new activities on the community explore page to 
            hopefully find someone looking to do the same thing they want to sign up for. As a user you can also look 
            through activities on your explore page to respond or add any to your dashboard and message other people on 
            Destined Duo who you would like to start an activity with. Our web applicationâ€™s easy-to-navigate design 
            will allow users to easily browse and hopefully find the right buddy to start a new adventure together!

    <h6>Why Destined Duo?</h6> 
	    <p> Destined Duo is a place that allows you interact with other individuals who may have the same interests as you and are a similar age as you.
            If you are young person who is looking to make friends with people who share the similar interests Destined Duo is the way to find people like you.
            All it takes is a quick search to find someone who has the 
            same interests as you in a certain activity, and now there is newfound friendship. This can be from creating study sessions for 
            different classes, to playing a sport or going to the gym with someone to connect with and spot you. It is limited to one person 
            per activity and through trying out different activities, one can meet a span of different people they would not have met had it 
            not been through Destined Duo. Things such as completing school work and hanging out at club/sports events is much more enjoyable 
            when you can have someone to enjoy it with. Parents also can be relieved, knowing that their children are not alone and are enjoying 
            their college experience as a result of using Destined Duo to connect with others. The people you meet online and connect with could 
            be potential future friends for the next 4 years that they are in college, and beyond!
